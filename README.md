# Cable Test V0.02

You want a PCB to exercise or learn to solder THT components, here you have one of many.
This provides you with a device to test network cables (RJ45) and telephone cables (RJ12 / 11),
made with normal components, (the most complicated being the LED bar).
You can be complemented with more diodes 1N4148 in anti-parallel soldiers under the LEDS (2, 5..9) to allow to check all cable faults.
